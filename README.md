Raspberry PI Lora Gateway/Node for RFM92/95/96/98/69HCW Modules
===============================================================

This shield is used to hold one or two HopeRF [Lora module][4] Software with Raspbery PI plus one FM12B/RFM69CW/RFM69(H)W.
it's the parent of the small [LoRasPi][11], so please look at LoRasPi [readme][12] to see features and software links.

This board has been mainly inspired from [Uptronics][14] expansion board on which I added some features but it's not a real LoraWAN concentrator, if you need a real concentrator with multiple channels and fully compliant to LoraWan stack capabilities, please see thethingsnetwork [wiki][1] dedicated to gateways.

By the way, with Lora modules installed on this board you can have it working as a Single Channel Gateway or a LoraWan node. For testing, demo or small projects, it can be enought.

Quick features 
==============

- Placement for two RFM92/95/96/98 Lora module (IE one 868MHz and one 433MHz, or 2 channels 868MHz)
- Placement for one RFM12B/RFM69CW/RFM69(H)W classic module
- Placement for choosing single Wire, SMA, u-FL or Thru Hole PCB Mount (Right Angle Tor straight)
by Eightwood Antenna type
- Vertical Antenna placement is possible (easier to drill RPI top enclosure)
- 4 x LED for visual indication
- Each Module reset pin can be connected to a RPI GPIO

Boards arrived from ElectroDragon, all is working as expected.

Detailed Description
====================

Look at the schematics for more informations.

SPI connexion is classic (MOSI/MISO/CLK), Chip Select is CE0 for Module 1 and CE1 for Module 2. Module 3 can be choosen between CE0 and GPIO26 with on board jumper switch.

```
Raspberry PI   RFM9x Module 1
   CE0     <---->  SEL
   GPIO5   <---->  Reset (JP5)
   GPIO25  <---->  DIO0 
   GPIO24  <---->  DIO5 

Raspberry PI   RFM9x Module 2
   CE1     <---->  SEL
   GPIO6   <---->  Reset (JP6)
   GPIO16  <---->  DIO0 
   GPIO12  <---->  DIO5 

Raspberry PI   RFM69/12 Module 3
 IO26/CE0  <---->  SEL
  GPIO13   <---->  Reset (JP13)
  GPIO23   <---->  DIO0 
  GPIO12   <---->  DIO2

Raspberry PI   On Board LEDS
   GPIO4   <---->  LED 4
   GPIO17  <---->  LED 17
   GPIO18  <---->  LED 18
   GPIO19  <---->  LED 19
```

### Hardware Setup

Nothing really complicated, you can wire Reset of each module on a GPIO pin if you want to be able to hardware reset then using software, in this case put jumper on JP5 for Module 1, JP6 for Module 2 and JP13 for Module 3. JPx number is the GPIO so JP5 is for GPIO5 ;-)

If you want to use Module 1 and Module 3 you need to set JP1 (Chip Select of module 3) to IO26 since CE0 is used by Module 1.

### Software Setup

I'm working on two libraries port and Single Channel Gateway to work on Raspberry PI, links are here   

- [LMIC][15] to be LoraWan compliant.  This LMIC is working with this shield, see [readme][18] of repo.
- Excellent [RadioHead][16] tweaked library for RFM69, RFM9x modules (and lot of others). This version is working with this shield, see [readme][17] of library.
- The Things Network [Single Channel Gateway packet forwarder][24]

I forked all repos to tweak them, but since I'm not sure original authors would like to merge my changes just use my forks. 

For reference, original libraries and code are [Arduino-LIMC][21], [RadioHead-LIMC][23], [Single Channel Gateway packet forwarder][25]

You can order the PCB of this board [PCBs.io][13]. PCBs.io give me some reward when you order my designed boards from their site. This is pretty good, because I can use these rewards to create and design new boards and order boards for a discounted price and share new boards.

### Assembled and mounted board

Here is my testing board, as you can see, 3 modules on it    
- Module 1 (top left) Lora RFM95 868MHz
- Module 2 (bottom left) Lora RFM98 433MHz
- Module 3 (right) RFM69HW 433MHz
